# Rallysimfans Richard Burns Rally: Cars and Stages Randomizer

My small program when learning C++

Car and Stages randomizer will give you option what surface you want to drive on (Tarmac, Gravel, Snow)<br>
When picked between those 3, the program will give you random stage and car to drive

The base idea from [CRSimRacing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd_v_1_8iM0 "Richard Burns Car&Stage Picker Python Script")'s car and stages picker python script but using C++ instead.

Feel free to use and modify it as your learning project

TODO: 
- adding choices between car classes
- adding randomizer for stages condition (dry/damp/wet)
